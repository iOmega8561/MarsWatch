## Disclaimer
This is learning project, it's not meant to be a production-ready 
application so expect issues to exist.

## What's this?
MarsWatch is an application meant to be a playground for  Swift 
concurrency and SwiftUI implementations. It is a simple piece of software that provides a gallery featuring the latest pictures shot during the martian missions.
It works by requesting data via http from api.nasa.gov, to then decode and parse in order to obtain the url of every image.

## API Key
In order for the application to work, an API key is needed. You should head to https://api.nasa.gov to obtain your own key.
