# MarsWatch
## Disclaimer
This is a personal project, it's not meant to be a production-ready 
application so expect issues to exist.

## What's this?
MarsWatch is an application meant to be a playground for myself, to experience Swift concurrency and SwiftUI implementations. 
It is a simple piece of software that provides a gallery featuring the latest pictures shot during the martian missions.
It works by requesting data via http from api.nasa.gov, to then decode and parse in order to obtain the url of every image.
